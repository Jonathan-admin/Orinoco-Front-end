# PROJECT 5 - Build an e-commerce site

To test project 5:
* You have to clone the back-end. This is a folder representing all of the code used to process information and communicate with a database.
  Without this folder, the application would simply not exist. It is fully provided by OpenClassrooms and it is with this code that we will
  have to work for the application to come to life and be fully dynamic.
  =>This is the server.
  
  To set it up, the GitHub repository must be cloned => [https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5.git](backend repository link) on your computer and npm must be installed locally on your machine. From the back-end folder you obtained, run `npm install`. Once node is installed, the `node server` command will launch the server. The default port of the localhost server is 3000 (Listening on port 3000). 
  
  "Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!" indicates that the connection to the database was successful. The server and the database are now operational.
  
  
* You also need to clone Orinoco-Front-end. This folder represents the work requested during the entire project. It will be the entire visible side of the iceberg for a visitor.
        
  We will focus on the visual aspect, the features that will run on the client side and we will send requests to the server in order to receive and send information.
  at the back-end. The folder is located at URL => [https://github.com/Jonathan-admin/Orinoco-Front-end.git](Front-end repository link).
  => It is the customer ..

  It consists:
  
            * A "fonts" folder including the different fonts of the application
            * A "templates" folder including the source code in HTML
            * An "images" folder including all the images of the site
            * A "styles" folder including CSS styles for the visual aspect
            * A "scripts" folder including all the JS code necessary for the dynamism of the application
            * From an HTML index.html file, the entry point of the application.
            * A readme file indicating the actions to be performed to test the front-end part of the Orinoco site.
        
       
 As the site is dynamic, it is preferable to use a local web server.
 We will open VSCode from the Orinoco-Front-end folder. You must then open the index.html file with Live Server.
 
 This module can be downloaded from the extensions section (right click then open with Live Server on index.html). The index.html page will then open in your browser in localhost [http://127.0.0.1:5500/Orinoco-Front-end/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/Orinoco-Front-end/index.html).

All that remains is to browse the site.
